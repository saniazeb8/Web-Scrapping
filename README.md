### Summary
This study investigates the evolution of parental care in contemporary societies, marked by increased involvement and prolonged investment in child-rearing, to understand its effects on family dynamics and societal health. It aims to analyze trends in parental time investment from 2003 to 2022 in the U.S., focusing on gender differences, educational gradient of parents, variations in childcare activities, and age group disparities. Additionally, it assesses the impact of parent's income on parental time investment, leveraging U.S. Census data and state-level heatmaps. The research also explores the experiences of parents practicing intensive parenting, examining the trade-offs between child-rearing and other life facets and their emotions when engaging in childcare-related discussions. Through this analysis, the study seeks to provide insights into the current dynamics of parental care and their wider societal implications, especially concerning intergenerational equity and well-being.

### Project Goals
